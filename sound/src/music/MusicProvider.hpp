 * Back-end interface for music search + playback.
 *
 * Implementations currently: `YouTubeMusicProvider` (shells out to yt-dlp
 * + ffmpeg and streams PCM through `StreamingSdlPlayer`).  Apple Music and
 * any other provider should plug in here so `MusicSession` and the
 * listener wiring stay unchanged.
 *
 * Contract:
 *   - `search()` returns the top candidate for `query` (or `nullopt` if
 *     the provider couldn't resolve anything).  Must NOT play audio.
 *   - `play()` is blocking — it should not return until playback has
 *     drained or been aborted.  `MusicSession` runs it on a background
 *     thread so the listener can keep capturing voice while audio
 *     streams.
 *   - `stop()` may be invoked concurrently from another thread to break
 *     `play()` early (e.g. on SIGINT or a "stop music" intent).
 *     Idempotent.
 *   - `pause()` / `resume()` are best-effort.  The default implementation
 *     is a no-op so providers that can't suspend their pipeline (e.g. a
 *     hypothetical streamer that has no SDL device of its own) still
 *     compile without ceremony — callers should treat them as advisory.
